## Project Description
Transmission line outages can have significant consequences, ranging from minor local disruptions to major long-term impacts. This project leverages LiDAR data to analyze and optimize the shielding effect of trees on transmission lines during lightning strikes.

### Key Components
1. **Mathematical Models**: Remodeling five LiDAR parameters to derive two critical tree parameters—distance to transmission lines and height.
2. **Data Flexibility**: The models allow for flexibility in data usage, enabling hypothetical scenario testing and validation without the need for real-time data retrieval.
3. **MATLAB Integration**: A MATLAB live script includes these models with a user interface for parameter tweaking, enhancing the practicality and usability of the models.

### Objectives
- **Availability**: Provide readily accessible mathematical models for quick validation and analysis.
- **Flexibility**: Enable modification and adaptation of models to fit various scenarios beyond the initial LiDAR data.
